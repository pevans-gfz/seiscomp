Set-up

To use this template, you'll need to:

#. Get the source code of the SeisComP documentation, e.g. from `GitHub`_

#. Copy this tutorial file (:file:`doc/base/tutorials/template.rst`) to the tutorials directory
   with a new name, :file:`doc/base/tutorials/{nn}_{something}.rst`.

#. Change the reference at the top (first line); it must be
   `_tutorials_{something}`.

#. Change the title: start with a verb, describe what the student is
   trying to do.

#. Set the tutorial task and a final confirmation action for the student
   to verify check that it worked correctly.

#. Add the file name without the ending *.rst* to the table of contents in :file:`doc/base/tutorials.rst`
   assigning a position for your new tutorial within the sequence of
   existing tutorials.

#. Build the HTML documentation for viewing and :ref:`testing <tutorials_template_testing>`.

#. Optionally, provide your new tutorial to the public repository:

   * Create a new git branch
   * Push the new branch to GitHub
   * Create a merge request to get your branch merged into the master branch
